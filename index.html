                    <h2>Tech that is always on my mind ðŸ‘‡</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>GPT-3, GANs and Deep Learning in general</h4>
                    <p>I'm a big fan of what OpenAI is doing, especially with their focus on ethical technology that benefits everyone. In a field like</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Brain Computer Interfaces</h4>
                    <p>Machine Learning and Deep Learning are trying to create the human brain in computers. Does it not make sense to create a computer for the human brain? This field needs more exploration and I'm passively interested in working here someday!</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>A better social media experience</h4>
                    <p>The internet is a wonderful thing. It has literally enabled someone from a small corner of the world to learn what the rest of the world is doing and also allowing me to pick up skills/knowledge that would have otherwise been practically inaccessible.
                        <br> <br>But modern means of communication have still not taken full advantage of this medium. The problems with current-day social media are well known and I feel it's about time better communication channels are built.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Climate change</h4>
                    <p>This one is a no-brainer. The Earth is home to 7.5 billion people and countless other organisms. We cannot 100% prevent it but we can still do our best and find ways to deal with the consequnces of past actions. I believe entrepreneurship will be key in this because economic incentive to deal with the consequences are enormous!
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <h4>Space Exploration</h4>
                    <p>Another big thing on my mind is the exploration of other worlds. Phenomena like climate change and meteorite impact only tell us that life is highly vulnerable and prone to total extinction. Making life multiplanetary is our best hope. Maybe we are the solution to the Fermi Paradox. (Heavily inspired by Elon Musk)
